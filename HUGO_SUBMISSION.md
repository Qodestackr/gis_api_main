# Hugo
Hugo is an efficient tool for Content Management written in Go. 

## Partial

When building sites, we need to manage content. Tools lie Gatsby or Hugo are efficient at this, Especially SSG/ ISR(with Next.js and so on..). A tool like Hugo will manage content in a `content` folder. In this folder, we can have markdown files that contain texts to be displayed on the site. These markdown files are like pages of your website.

## Shortcodes
Shortcodes in Hugo are simple placeholders that we can use in our content files to inject dynamic content or execute predefined functions. They are enclosed within curly braces `{{ }}` and are usually used to add dynamic elements, such as images, videos, or custom functionalities, to your content. Shortcodes can be created by the user or provided by Hugo themes.
